## Short description
adguard-pihole is a simple repository for managing custom filters for AdGuard Home. It contains text files for whitelisting and blacklisting, which can be easily added to AdGuard Home or PiHole.

## Installation
There is no installation required for this project since it is not a program. Simply add raw list to AdGuard Home or PiHole.

| List       | Link with raw text |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Allow List |      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JarnotMaciej/adguard-pihole/main/exact-allowlist.txt              |
| Block List |    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JarnotMaciej/adguard-pihole/main/exact-blacklist.txt                |
| Regex Block List           |       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JarnotMaciej/adguard-pihole/main/regex-blacklist.txt             |

In lists.txt there are some lists which I am using.

---
This project is meant for users who prefer to manage their custom filters using GitHub rather than directly modifying AdGuard Home or PiHole configurations.
Please feel free to customize and update the filters according to your needs.
